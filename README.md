### Now for a little internet optimism

# at_libraries
Welcome to at_libraries. This project is open with intentâ€”we encourage contributions, and we want pull requests to hear about issues.

## What is this for?
This repository contains three @protocol libraries for developers building their own @platform applications. (These libraries can also be found on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages))

[at_contact](https://pub.dev/packages/at_contact): A contacts library that persists across different @platform applications. You can see this dependency in action by cloning the at_chat_flutter project from the at_widgets repository.

[at_lookup](https://pub.dev/packages/at_lookup): A low-level library that directly implements the @protocol verbs. You can find this dependency in several other packages such as at_client and at_client_mobile.

[at_server_status](https://pub.dev/packages/at_server_status): A helpful library that logs the status of the root server as well as a secondary server of your choice.

## How do I install?
All installation guidelines are written in their respective directories and pub.dev sites. Click on the links above for those details.

## Maintainers
**TODO**: Please identify who created this repository and how to contact them.
